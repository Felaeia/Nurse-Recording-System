# Nurse Recording System

A Project from ACLC College of Mandaue for Software Engineering I.

The Patient Tracker System is a C# ASP.NET Core Web API and Vue 3 Vite frontend designed to assist communication between students and clinic nurses. It manages patient form submissions, notifications, medicine inventory, and clinic status updates with real-time synchronization across mobile and web clients.

This system ensures that students can quickly report health issues while nurses receive timely notifications, manage patient records, and keep the clinic’s operational status and inventory updated.
